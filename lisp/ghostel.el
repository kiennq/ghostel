;;; Commentary:

;; Ghostel is an Emacs terminal emulator powered by libghostty-vt, the
;; terminal emulation library extracted from the Ghostty project.  A
;; native Zig dynamic module handles VT parsing, terminal state, and
;; rendering, while this Elisp layer manages the shell process, keymap,
;; buffer, and user-facing commands.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   M-x ghostel          Open a new terminal
;;   M-x ghostel-project  Open a terminal in the current project root
;;   M-x ghostel-other    Switch to next terminal or create one
;;
;; Key bindings in the terminal buffer:
;;
;;   Most keys are sent directly to the shell.  Keys in
;;   `ghostel-keymap-exceptions' (C-c, C-x, M-x, etc.) pass through
;;   to Emacs.  Terminal control and navigation use a C-c prefix:
;;
;;   C-c C-c   Interrupt          C-c C-z   Suspend
;;   C-c C-d   EOF                C-c C-\   Quit
;;   C-c C-t   Copy mode          C-c C-y   Paste
;;   C-c C-l   Clear scrollback   C-c C-q   Send next key literally
;;   C-c M-w   Copy scrollback    C-y / M-y Yank / yank-pop
;;   C-c C-n / C-c C-p            Next/previous hyperlink
;;   C-c M-n / C-c M-p            Next/previous prompt (OSC 133)
;;
;; Copy mode (C-c C-t) freezes the display and enables standard Emacs
;; navigation.  Set mark with C-SPC, select text, then M-w to copy.
;;
;; Shell integration:
;;
;;   Directory tracking (OSC 7), prompt navigation (OSC 133), and the
;;   `ghostel_cmd' helper are auto-injected for bash, zsh, and fish —
;;   no shell rc changes needed.  Controlled by `ghostel-shell-integration'
;;   (default t); set it to nil to source etc/shell/ghostel.{bash,zsh,fish}
;;   manually instead.
;;
;; Native module:
;;
;;   A pre-built binary is downloaded automatically on first use.  To
;;   build from source instead (requires Zig 0.15.2+), run zig build
;;   from the project root, or M-x ghostel-module-compile.  M-x
;;   ghostel-download-module re-fetches the pre-built binary.
;;
;; See also: evil-ghostel.el (evil-mode integration), ghostel-compile.el
;; (TTY-backed M-x compile replacement), ghostel-eshell.el (eshell
;; visual-command integration).  TRAMP paths as `default-directory'
;; spawn remote shells; see README.md for details.

  "Value of the TERM environment variable for ghostel processes.

The default \"xterm-ghostty\" advertises ghostel's capability set via
the bundled terminfo entry: synchronized output (DEC 2026), Kitty
keyboard protocol, true color, colored underlines, focus reporting,
and more.  Apps that key off these capabilities — Claude Code, modern
TUIs, neovim, tmux — will use their fast paths.  Notably,
synchronized output eliminates choppy partial-redraw effects when
Claude Code or similar TUIs repaint over a large scrollback.

OSC 52 clipboard is supported (`ghostel-enable-osc52', off by
default) but intentionally NOT advertised in the bundled terminfo,
to avoid silent yank drops when the option is disabled.

Set to \"xterm-256color\" to fall back to a generic terminal.  When
`ghostel-term' is not \"xterm-ghostty\", the bundled terminfo and
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty' are not advertised, so nothing claims to be
Ghostty.  This is also the right setting if outbound `ssh' from a
ghostel buffer trips up on remote hosts that lack the xterm-ghostty
terminfo entry."

  "Extra environment variables for ghostel shell processes.

A list of \"KEY=VALUE\" strings, prepended to `process-environment'
before spawning the shell.  A bare \"KEY\" (no `=') unsets the variable.

For local spawns, entries here take precedence over ghostel's own
variables (`TERM', `INSIDE_EMACS', `EMACS_GHOSTEL_PATH',
shell-integration vars), so a user who sets `TERM' here wins — which
will also disable ghostel's shell integration if the chosen TERM
breaks its assumptions.

Also honored via `dir-locals.el' for per-project overrides.

TRAMP caveats:
- Entries with `=' are propagated to the remote shell.
- `TERM' and `INSIDE_EMACS' are *always* reset by TRAMP to
  `tramp-terminal-type' and TRAMP's own marker respectively (see
  `tramp-handle-make-process'); overrides in `ghostel-environment'
  do not win remotely.
- Bare \"KEY\" unset works for TRAMP-sh methods (`ssh', `sudo', ...)
  which emit `unset KEY' in the remote wrapper, but is dropped by
  the generic handler used by `adb' and `sshfs'.

Example: \\='(\"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" \"CC=clang\")"

The full scrollback is materialized into the Emacs buffer so that

across history.  Each materialized row also lives in the Emacs
buffer with text properties for color/style/links, so the
practical Emacs heap cost is roughly equal to the libghostty

zsh, and fish shell integration bundled with ghostel emits these
markers automatically when `ghostel-shell-integration' is enabled.

The hook fires synchronously from the terminal parser, so consumers
that need a fully rendered buffer should defer their own work via
`run-at-time'.  Errors in hook functions are demoted to messages
via `with-demoted-errors', so a misbehaving hook does not break

This is the middle of the full detection pattern; ghostel wraps it
with a fixed leading path-boundary anchor (line start or any
non-path character) and a fixed `:LINE[:COL]' tail, so any match
is guaranteed to end in `:DIGITS'.

The matched path is resolved against `default-directory'; linkification
only applies when that file exists.  The default matches absolute
paths, explicit `./' paths, and bare relative paths containing at
least one `/' (e.g. compiler output like `src/main.rs').  Paths
embedded in punctuation like `(/home/user/index.js:17:5)' are
supported via the fixed anchor.

Performance: each match triggers a filesystem check on every redraw.
Broadening this pattern (for example to match bare `file.go' without
a `/') will cause `file-exists-p' to be called for every matching
token, which can be expensive on slow or network filesystems (NFS,
FUSE).  The default uses non-backtracking character classes so the
per-redraw scan stays cheap."

viewport rewrite) while libghostty's logical content is preserved.

`ghostel--delayed-redraw' uses a heuristic to distinguish Emacs
clamping `window-start' to `point-min' (restore from saved key) from a
legitimate user scroll to a different valid position (refresh saved
key to match).  The heuristic misfires if Emacs moves `window-start'
to a non-`point-min' non-saved position (e.g. programmatic
`recenter', `follow-mode', window split layouts); in that case the
saved key is refreshed to the new content and the original scroll

makes `scroll-conservatively' shift `window-start' up by one row,
fighting the viewport pin and hiding the block cursor:

 1. Pending-wrap: the last printed character filled the rightmost
    column and the next print will soft-wrap (issue #138).

 2. CUP park onto an empty trailing row, no pending-wrap: the TUI
    moved the cursor via absolute positioning to a row that has no
    written cells, so the row renders to an empty buffer line and PT
    lands at `point-max' (issue #157).

Clamp `window-point' back by one in either case so it sits inside the
viewport; buffer-point is unaffected and subsequent redraws recapture
the real cursor.  We must NOT clamp for a plain shell prompt where the
cursor is legitimately at `point-max' after typing — doing so would
draw the block cursor on the last character instead of after it
